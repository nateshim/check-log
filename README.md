## SWOT Analysis

#### Strengths:
- Ability to develop quickly.
- A good understanding of the code architecture on both the front and backend.

#### Weaknesses:
- Ideas are not fully flushed out yet which might lead into roadblocks
- Efficient CSS coding  

#### Opportunities:
- There is an opportunity to make a really clean and flushed out app that I have yet to see in the market.

#### Threats:
- I tend to bite off more than I can chew during development.
